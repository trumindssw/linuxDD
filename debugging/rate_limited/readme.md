Sometimes, drivers run in a loop or under heavy load, generating too many printk messages. This floods the logs and slows the system. To avoid this, the kernel provides rate-limited variants of printk()

Use printk_ratelimited() to avoid log flooding.

Very useful in fast loops, high-frequency paths.

Keeps your logs clean and avoids kernel slowdowns.
